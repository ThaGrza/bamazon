## Motivation / What is it
Bamazon is a node based application that replicates a simply online store where you can select an item from inventory by item id number, select quantity and purchase said item. If that item is not in stock or if the quantity is too great you will be redirected to reorder.
## How to
To use Bamazon simply type node bamazonCustomer.js into bash and be prompted by node to select on item by number.
Once a successful sale as been made the application ends. If an order cannot be placed due to quantity or stock, user will be prompted to a new sale.
